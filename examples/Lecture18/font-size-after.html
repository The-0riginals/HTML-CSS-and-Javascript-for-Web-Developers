<!-- The em is simply the font size. In an element with a 2in font, 
  1em thus means 2in. Expressing sizes, such as margins and paddings, 
  in em means they are related to the font size, and if the user has a big font (e.g., on a big screen) 
  or a small font (e.g., on a handheld device), the sizes will be in proportion -->
<!-- 
  Pixel is a static measurement, while percent and EM are relative measurements. The size of an EM or percent depends on its parent. If the text size of body is 16 pixels, then 150% or 1.5 EM will be 24 pixels (1.5 * 16). Look at CSS Units for more measurement units.
 2em(200%) = 2*16px=32px
